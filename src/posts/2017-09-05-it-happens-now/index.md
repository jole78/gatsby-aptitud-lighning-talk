Since the start of Aptitud five years ago we've been focusing on being a company driven and owned by the employees. With trust as a foundation and with an attitude that all mistakes can be fixed we have have been able to move fast and freely. We have trusted the decisions made by others in the company and trialed-and-errored our way forward. The ones with the most energy and inspiration have chipped in a bit more while those needing to step back and focus on others things for a while have done so. Confident in knowing that the company is in the good hands of colleagues. That's the way it's been working, but it hasn't been reflected in the ownership of the company.  

But that is solved now! When two of the founders decided to leave Aptitud we were given a possibility to fix this. Now all employees are owners with a voting majority in Aptitud. In that, we have now manifested our everyday life - the way we have been operating the last five years. This feels great and exciting! And it feels like a prerequisite for our "unOrganization". An organization that more and more feels like a living organism that moves forward, develops and changes.

Now we'll continue along this path, feeling stronger than ever, having taken a big step towards what we are trying to achieve. A company with to 40-45 employees, in constant movement with sustainability, trust, and love as pillars. 

Everyone that works at Aptitud has a passion for their work but many have families, and family always comes first. Almost everyone has strong interests that take alot of time. We don't want to be an obstacle here - quite the contrary; we want to be an enabler. We have created a model where you don't have to feel ashamed or get broke for actually having a life that you want to live outside of work. We have, for example, built in slack time. And we don't do compensatory time or control how many hours you have put in each week. We have no need for control. It's a time thief and creates irritation and worry. Like asking for leave or asking to attend a conference or training. We have removed those elements and itt works really well. Its easier, more fun and we're happier. 

If you want to work with us we now have two basic requirements; you have to become an associate and you have to trust us. We will trust you. From day 1. 

To infinity and beyondâ€¦
